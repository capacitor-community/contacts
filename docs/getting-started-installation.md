## Setup

### iOS

Apple requires the following usage description to be added and filled out for your app in `Info.plist`:

- `NSContactsUsageDescription` (`Privacy - Contacts Usage Description`)

Read about [Configuring `Info.plist`](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios/configuration#configuring-infoplist) in the [iOS Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios) for more information on setting iOS permissions in Xcode

#### Accessing the notes in contact entries

To be able to request the notes in contract entries in iOS 13 or later, your app must have the `com.apple.developer.contacts.notes` entitlement. You can read more about this in the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_contacts_notes).

### Android

This API requires the following permissions to be added to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Contacts API -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS" />
```

As the naming itself suggests, the first permission is needed for reading contact entries (e.g. when calling the `getContacts` method) and the second permission is needed for writing contact entries (e.g. when calling the `createContact` method).

Read about [Setting Permissions](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/configuration#setting-permissions) in the [Android Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android) for more information on setting Android permissions.
